Solidoodle went out of business in March of 2016.  The solidoodle 4 was their last printer made in Brooklyn.

I had a hard time getting started with the printer so I wrote down my notes
here.

## Software
I used [Repetier Host](https://www.repetier.com/) on Windows to connect to the
printer.  I gave up on running Linux because the serial connection was
troublesome. By all accounts it works fine on Linux with a little fiddling.

I used the **Manual Control** portion of Repetier Host to Load/Unload filament
and do other sanity checks on the printer.

## Calibration
The [Solidoodle Wiki](http://wiki.solidoodle.com/) has calibration instructions
and everything else you need to get started.
