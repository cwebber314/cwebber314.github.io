These are my charts for using common machine screws in printed parts.

## Socket Cap Screws
To be safe, drill the printed hole to the proper diameter.  The printed parts may crack if the hole is printed too small.  Also most pritned parts work just fine without drilling. 

| Diameter | Drive Size | Tap Size (printed hole) | US Drill size |
|--------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------|
| 3mm      | 2.5mm      | 2.5mm                   | between 3/32" or 7/64" |


## Set Screws
4mm set screws are the smallest screws available at Home Depot

| Size | Diameter | US Drill size     | Allen Wrench (Drive Size)  |
| ---- | -------- | ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| 4mm  | 3.4 mm   | between 1/8" and 9/64" | 2mm |
| 5mm  | 4.3 mm   | 11/64" | 2.5mm |
| 6mm  | 5.2 mm   | 13/64" | 4 mm |


## Wood Screws
Flat head wood screws.  With this table, the wood screw will not cut the printed part.

| Size | Diameter | Max Head Diameter | 
| ---- | -------- | ----------------- |
| #6 | 3.5 mm | 7.1 mm |
| #8 | 4.2 mm | 8.4 mm |

## Printing Countersink Hole
The most common angles for screw heads are 82deg and 90deg.  Assume 90 degrees because that's ther easier number.

For a chamfer operation (Fusion 360 and friends):

| Size | Chamfer Distance | Chamfer Angle 
| ---- | ---------------- | ----------------- | 
| #6   | 1.8 mm | 45 |
| #8   | 2.1 mm | 45 |

For a cylinder with a top and bottom diameter use this table [TODO]

| Size | Bottom Diameter  | Top Diameter | Height | 
| ---- | ---------------- | -------------| ------ |
| #6   | TODO | 7.1 mm | TODO |
| #8   | TODO | 8.4 mm | TODO |
